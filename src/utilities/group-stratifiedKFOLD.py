# For example, let’s say we have a problem in which we would like to build a model to detect skin cancer from skin images of patients. Our task is to build a binary classifier which takes an input image and predicts the probability for it being benign or malignant.  
 
# In these kinds of datasets, you might have multiple images for the same patient in the training dataset. So, to build a good cross-validation system here, you must have stratified k-folds, but you must also make sure that patients in training data do not appear in validation data. Fortunately, scikit-learn offers a type of cross-validation known as GroupKFold. Here the patients can be considered as groups. But unfortunately, there is no way to combine GroupKFold with StratifiedKFold in scikit-learn. So you need to do that yourself. I’ll leave it as an exercise for the reader.
